The Structural Simulation Toolkit \cite{sst} is central to our evaluation methodology.
SST provides a distributed simulation framework with a versatile, configurable memory system model, including VaultSim, a model of 3D stacked DRAM.
To SST we couple MacSim \cite{macsim}, a trace-driven processor and GPU simulator, and CHDL, a \texttt{C++} hardware design and simulation library.
