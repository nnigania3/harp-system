The work remaining is non-trivial and includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Evaluate system architectures and establish a baseline
  \item Expanding the feature set of Harmonica
  \item Performance optimization for both FPGA and silicon targets
  \item Building a capable PTX to HARP Translator
  \item Implementing a custom memory controller
  \item Adding support for HMC to the cache model
\end{itemize}
