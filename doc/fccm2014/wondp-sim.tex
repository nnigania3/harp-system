This paper reports on the status of {\name}-- an integrated compute-memory system architecture for massively parallel, irregular, data intensive applications.
The major components are a customizable bulk synchronous data parallel architecture integrated with a stacked DRAM memory system and interconnected with a flexible network and package model.
Given the nascent state of processor-near-memory (PNM) architectures, \name has adopted an approach based on the ability to rapidly develop and analyze a space of potential architectural solutions.
The proposed environment is novel in the ability to integrate application binaries, cycle level timing models, and physical models (power, thermal) into a single simulation model.
In particular, we focus on heterogeneous near-memory architectures employing multi-layer (stacked) DRAM technologies with in-stack or in-package multithreaded, data-parallel processing elements running both traditional and irregular CUDA and OpenCL workloads.
The environment couples a customizable \texttt{C++}-based data parallel architecture synthesis/generation framework with microarchitecture level full system simulation models.
We report on the current status, capabilities and future plans. 

%At the start any systematic study of a class of techniques in computer architecture, it is important to specify, broadly, a set of architectures your group intends to explore, a set of applications with which these architectures will be evaluated, a programming model for these applications, and a set of simulation tools to be used to perform these evaluations.
%Collectively, these four traits define a  position on approaching a research topic.
%The authors are focusing on heterogeneous near-memory architectures employing multi-layer (stacked) DRAM technologies with in-stack or in-package multithreaded, data-parallel processing elements running both traditional and irregular CUDA and OpenCL workloads.
%These architectures are being evaluated using a two-pronged approach: (1) a simulation stack composed of the MacSim trace-driven processor and GPU simulator, the Structural Simulation Toolkit (SST) simulation framework, and the CHDL low-level hardware design environment and (2) a CHDL-based FPGA prototyping toolchain.
