\title{The Elements of Thesis} %% If you want to specify a linebreak
                               %% in the thesis title, you MUST use
                               %% \protect\\ instead of \\, as \\ is a
                               %% fragile command that \MakeUpperCase
                               %% will break!

\chapter{Introduction}

Every dissertation should have an introduction.  You might not realize
it, but the introduction should introduce the concepts, backgrouand,
and goals of the dissertation.

\section{Concepts}

This is where we talk about the concepts behind the dissertation.

\subsection{Primary Concept}

This is the primary concept.

\subsection{Secondary Concept}

This is the secondary concept.

\subsubsection{Even more secondary}

This is really not all that important.

Perry H. Disdainful was born in an insignificant town
whose only claim to fame is that it produced such a fine

\begin{abstract}
  This is the abstract that must be turned in as hard copy to the
  thesis office to meet the UMI requirements. It should \emph{not} be
  included when submitting your ETD. Comment out the abstract
  environment before submitting. It is recommended that you simply
  copy and paste the text you put in the summary environment into this
  environment. The title, your name, the page count, and your
  advisor's name will all be generated automatically.
