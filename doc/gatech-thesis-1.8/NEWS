  chapter title formating. Significant changes to approval page. New
  command \approveddate{} for the date that should show on the

  for committee members, allowing the affiliation to be specified.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ version 1.7 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________ version 1.6 ________________

  can simply download a small patchfile and copy it into your
  localtexmf tree.

  oneandahalfspaced linespacing, and Vita format.
