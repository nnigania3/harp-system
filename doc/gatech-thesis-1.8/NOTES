listings.sty + caption2.sty
  IF you use the 'index=' option in listings.sty for captionless listings, 
  but you also have the caption2.sty packag loaded, it breaks.
  Don't do that.  Either do without captionless listings, or don't use
  the caption2.sty package.  This has been reported to the listings.sty
  maintainer.

hyperref:
  if you have section names or figure captions in your TOC or LOF that 
  are longer than a single line, hyperref barfs.  Make sure you are using
  the breaklinks option.

  Also, you must use the 'hypertexnames=false' option, and the plainpages
  option.  Without these, the duplication of pagenums (front matter is
  1...X in roman, but that still dups the 1...X in the body)

index.sty
  is in the "camel" package in MikTeX

ulem.sty     - better underlining behavior.  Use the \normalem option.

gatech-thesis-losa.sty  - addon for list of symbols. Depends on gloss.sty
gatech-thesis-gloss.sty - addon for glossaries. Depends on gloss.sty
gatech-thesis-index.sty - addon for indexes. Depends on index.sty and
                          multicol.sty

gloss.sty    - improved glossary generation, using bibtex
index.sty    - improved index generation
multicol.sty - multiple columns on a page, without requiring \newpage.

txfonts is the *way* to go.  It seems to be the most hassle free way
to get Times, with good math support.  Forget the times package, mathtime,
belleek, and mathptmx.  Use txfonts.
