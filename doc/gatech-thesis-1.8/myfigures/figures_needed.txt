D Cache micro-arch
D The input and output signals to the cache can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig: cache block}
D The MMU can be divided into 4 major components as can be seen in ~\ref{fig: MMU}
D As for the design, the main components are the core, the cache and the memory controller- as can be seen in the Figure~\ref{fig: System Overview}.
