This directory contains a basic "thesis" formatted using the
gatech-thesis.cls.  The text is taken from the first five
chapters of Jules Verne's ``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,'' 
from Project Gutenberg

  ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberk/etext94/2000010.txt
Project Gutenberg etexts may be freely redistributed in any form,
as long as the original unmodified document accompanies the 
modified excerpts.  To satisfy this requirement, please do not
distribute this example without the 2000010.txt file which is in
the parent directory.

To run the example, you must first install all of the following
files in the appropriate locations in your texmf (or localtexmf) tree.
   <texmf>/tex/latex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis.cls
   <texmf>/bibtex/bst/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis.bst

This example only requires two additional style files, which are 
both part of the base latex distribution, so that shouldn't be
a problem.  These packages are:

   graphicx  -- this is a 'standard' package; you should already have it
   color     -- ditto

Then, make sure that latex & friends are in your path, and run the DO_*.sh
scripts (or the DO_*.bat files).

For a more complicated example of what is possible, and a demonstration
of the new add-on style files for glossaries and indices, see the
sibling `bellswhistles' example.
