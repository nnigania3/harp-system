Project Gutenberg etexts may be freely redistributed in any form,
as long as the original unmodified document accompanies the 
modified excerpts.  To satisfy this requirement, please do not
distribute the examples in those subdirectories without the 
original text, in the 2000010.txt file in *this* directory.
