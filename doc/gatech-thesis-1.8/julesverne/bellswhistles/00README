This directory contains a reworked version of the jules-verne
example "thesis".  However, all of the bells and whistles 
provided by the gatech-thesis.cls class and associated styles
are exercised, along with some suggestions for thesis document 
structuring.

The text is taken from the first five chapters of Jules Verne's 
``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,'' from Project Gutenberg
  http://promo.net/pg/
  ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberk/etext94/2000010.txt

as long as the original unmodified document accompanies the

distribute this example without the 2000010.txt file which is
in the parent directory.

Features:
  1)  segregating preamble code into a document-specific style

  2)  support for using either latex+dvips or pdflatex to
      generate .ps and .pdf versions

  3)  How to easily generate OGS format complant documents
      and prettier, "personal" copies.

  4)  Support for using hyperref (clickable links in the TOC,
      when making a .pdf)

  5)  Using postscript versions of fonts other than Computer Modern,
      like Times, Courier, etc.  See extensive comments in
      jules-verne.sty.

  6)  Using additional symbol fonts (latexsym, textcomp + fixups)

  7)  Using the listings package for including program code
      in appendices

  8)  Useful macros for referencing Figures, Equations, etc.

  9)  Using the add-on style gatech-thesis-gloss.sty for 
      generating a Glossary or List of Nomenclature

  10) Using the add-on style gatech-thesis-losa.sty for 
      generating a "List of Symbols or Abbreviations")

  11) Using the add-on style gatech-thesis-index.sty for 
      generating an index.  Typically a GT thesis doesn't
      have one of these, but the style is provided just in case.

  12) Demonstrate the multivolume support, for those theses that
      are over 2.5" thick (according to OGS Guidelines).

  13) Using \include instead of \input to incorporate subsidiary
      files into the main document.  This lets you use \includeonly
      to speed development of your document.  (But see the 
      hack-part.tex file for an explanation of a LaTeX bug that
      is exposed, and the workaround)

To run the example, you must first install all of the following
files in the appropriate locations in your texmf (or localtexmf) tree.
   <texmf>/tex/latex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis.cls
   <texmf>/tex/latex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis-patch.sty
   <texmf>/tex/latex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis-gloss.sty
   <texmf>/tex/latex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis-losa.sty
   <texmf>/tex/latex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis-index.sty
   <texmf>/bibtex/bst/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis.bst
   <texmf>/bibtex/bst/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis-losa.bst
   <texmf>/makeindex/gatech-thesis/gatech-thesis-index.ist

Then, of course, you need all of the packages that this mega-example
uses.  Use whatever tool is the normal mechanism for installing
additional packages in your tex system -- on MikTeX, that's 'MikTeX 
Options'.  The required packages are:

   graphicx  -- this is a 'standard' package; you should already have it
   color     -- ditto
   fontenc   -- ditto
   textcomp  -- ditto
   latexsym  -- ditto
   ifthen    -- ditto
   url       -- ditto

   txfonts   -- not a default package. You'll need to install this one.
   hyperref
   subfigure
   caption2
   amsmath
   amsfonts
   amssymb
   listings  -- make sure to also install the lstpatch.sty file from 
                2002-08-06 or newer, available here if your TeX dist
                doesn't provide it: http://www.atscire.de/products/listings/
   thumbpdf  -- this one is tricky to use on Windows (it contains a 
                perl support script, and needs access to ghostscript)
                Comment it out in jules-verne.sty and in the two
                do_*.sh scripts.
   longtable
   colortbl
   dcolumn

Then, make sure that latex & friends are in your path, and run the DO_*.sh
scripts (or the DO_*.bat files).  And be sure to actually READ the
jules-verne.sty document-specific style; it is heavily commented with lots
of useful information.

Now, many of these features aren't used (and shouldn't be used) when
generating your official, final paper copy for submission.  That's 
all handled by the options passed to the jules-verne.sty style and
to the gatech-thesis.cls from your main, root document.  See the
first 20 or so lines in jules-verne.tex.  For official copies, 
you'd do this:
  \documentclass{gatech-thesis}
  \usepackage[official]{jules-verne}

Actually, you'd probably make a copy of jules-verne.sty (say,
'johnthesis.sty') and modify it to suit.  But you knew that already.

You might notice that there is no example .pdf, .ps, or .dvi file
included in this 'bells and whistles' directory.  That's by 
design: for the most part, these bells and whistles are intended for
your personal copies and drafts, NOT for the "official" document.

And there are already examples of how an official document should
look, in the main directory and in the julesverne/basic directory.
