First of all, I would like to express deepest sense of gratitude to my advisor Dr. Hyesoon Kim whose energy, enthusiasm and constant support inspired me from the beginning till the end of the project. I am indebted to her for her ideas, valuable guidance and the encouragement throughout. 

I would like to thank various faculty members of Georgia Institute Of Technology from whom I have benefited as a student. 
I express my sincere gratitude to Chad Kersey and Syed Minhaj Hassan whose support had proved invaluable during the course of the project. I would not have been able to finish in time if not for their help with the building blocks and design tools. Last but not least, I would like to thank Nagesh, Jaekyu, Jaewoong, Pranith, JooHwan, Hyojong and Dilan, my friends in the HPArch lab for their support and the friendly atmosphere in lab. 

Finally, I dedicate this thesis to my parents, my brother and Neha who make even my smallest success meaningful.
