\section{ System Overview }
The aim of this work was to design a custom GP-GPU as a starting point to explore future designs. Since we wanted the whole system to be customized, a custom ISA %(\cite{schreier}) 
called ``HARP'' was used for this work. The ISA is an MIPS-based ISA with support for several customizations, which are discussed in the next section. The key features are predication support, configurable instruction width, number of general-purpose and predicate registers, and vector support. 

As for the design, the main components are the core, the cache, and the memory controller, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview}. Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview} is a simple design we used just to demonstrate different components. Each of these components is discussed separately in the next section. We will also look at the different possible systems we can design in Chapter 4. The core that implements the main pipeline and the memory management unit was written in ``CHDL'' which is our custom high-level synthesis tool.%\cite{schreier}.
The cache was written in Verilog and the memory controller IP was generated using Altera's FPGA tools (Quartus II, \cite{quartus}). Even though we have built a system using a particular configuration, we can use this flow to try many different scenarios. For example, if we want to built a system that uses a new kind of memory system (example HMC \cite{hmc}), all we would have to do is to replace the DDR2 controller we are using now with the IP of the new memory controller and everything else will remain the same. We can also add new instructions to the ISA and add support to the core (like support for multiple warps similar to commercial GPUs), keeping everything in the uncore part unchanged.

As we can see in Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview}, our design supports multiple cores, and each core can support SIMD, thus creating a GPGPU or an SIMD CPU as one would like to call it. To enable support for multiple cores, we have also designed the arbitrator, which sends requests from the private caches of each core to the shared cache. Also similar to the way GPGPUs are designed, our design does not support coherence among the private caches of each of the cores. So, the programmer should be aware of this fact and must write code accordingly. For the current work, most benchmarks are written in HARP assembly but one of the future tasks as part of this project is to design a CUDA/OpenCL-HARP translator, which would allow us to run more general commercially available applications.

\section{ CHDL }
CHDL is the custom environment used to generate HDL (hardware description language) using C++. It has similarities to System C and other HSL (high level synthesis) languages \cite{hls_overview}. We used CHDL so that, as previously mentioned, the same code written in C++ can be used for the FPGA flow as well as for the simulation flow. CHDL is implemented as a source-source translator, which translates high level C++ to Verilog HDL. It offers a set of C++ libraries to support correct translation of code to its Verilog equivalent. Even though we write in C++, we still have to think to some extent about what the generated Verilog code will look like. For example, one thing to keep in mind is that assignments to wires (represented as a vector of Boolean) are continuous and we can assign the wire only once in our code. We discuss some examples later that give a good overview of this framework in terms of its ease of use and the restrictions it places on the programmer.

%More details of CHDL along with examples can be found in Appendix A.
There are several advantages to taking the CHDL approach; as we write code in C++ it becomes easy to describe complex functions using simple code as compared to Verilog. Also, since we already have a library of commonly used functions, we can write code quickly; for example we have implementations of multiplexers, decoder, encoders, state machines etc. This allows us to significantly reduce our code density. The author in \cite{codedensity} shows that a 1M-gate design requires about 300k lines of RTL, whereas using a higher level of abstraction can reduce that by 7x-10x \cite{hls_overview}.

There are some down sides to using this high-level synthesis approach though. Since we can describe a lot of complex functionality using this approach, it might not always generate the most optimal Verilog code. We can expect the Verilog compiler to optimize the code and remove redundancies, but we would be able to generate better code if we write directly in Verilog. The authors in \cite{hls_overview} give a good overview of HSL (high level synthesis) frameworks and discuss the quality of HDL generated. Another downside of using this approach is that it is very hard to debug, as the signal/variable names are lost in the code generated and we have to specify signals using special debug statements if we want to preserve the name to help us in debugging. It is also hard to fix or improve a critical path in the design to improve the performance.%The verilog code is also huge in size and unreadable.

Figure~\ref{fig:chdl_simple_example} shows a simple example of code written using CHDL compared with its Verilog equivalent. The Verilog code generated from CHDL is about 106 lines compared to about 10 lines in Verilog. As can be seen, this is a code for a simple 5 bit counter. The Verilog code is implied; as for the CHDL version, we represent the counter as a vector of boolean with 5 bits. The ``Reg'' statement translates to ``always@(posedge clk) output \textless= input;'' in Verilog. The assignments in CHDL are similar to the ``assign'' statement in Verilog.

Similarly, if we want to implement basic operations we can directly use statements like those shown in Figure~\ref{fig:chdl_alu_example}. This figure shows the implementation of a basic ALU where the final output is that coming out from the multiplexer, which selects the correct output based on the ``op'' signal, which acts as the selector.

\section{FPGA board and Development Tools}
The FPGA board used for our experiment is a Terasic DE3 board. It uses an Altera FPGA for prototyping. The FPGA used is a Stratix III 3SL150 FPGA with 142,000 logic elements (LEs). The DE3 board also has support for DDR2 RAM, leds, 7-segement display, and connectors to stack multiple boards. Figure~\ref{fig:board2} shows a picture of the FPGA board used for this work. 

We used Altera's FPGA tools for development purposes. The Quartus 11.3 tool \cite{quartus} was used to synthesize the HDL and program the FPGA device via USB. We used ModelSim for the RTL and gate-level simulation experiments. As for other tools used, we also used open source tools like ``iVerilog'' \cite{iverilog} to compile our Verilog code and dump wave signals to a file, which we then viewed using ``gtkwave'' \cite{gtkwave}. The DDR2 was used along with Altera's DDR2 memory controller IP. More about the DDR2 controller is discussed in Chapter 3. The Quartus tool with a built-in IP generator called ``Megacore wizard'' was used to generate the memory controller IPs along with other commonly used IPs like PLLs for managing clocks.
