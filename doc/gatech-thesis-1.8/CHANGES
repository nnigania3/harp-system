This file contains a (fairly) detailed list of changes to the
gatech-thesis.cls file.  For even more gory detail, see the
ChangeLog file.  For a quick overview, see the NEWS file.

______________ version 1.8 ________________
* Remove bold from volume (part) titles in Table of Contents.
* Fix bug that was preventing hyperref and overpic from working
  concurrently.
* Revise abstract environment to produce an abstract page that meets the
  UMI requirements, rather than just replicating the summary page.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ version 1.8 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________ version 1.7 ________________
* Remove double spacing of thesis title as per July 2005 manual.
* Reduce font size of title (title page and approval page) and
  chapter titles. (Requested by OGS)
* Reduce font size of author on title page. (Requested by OGS)
* Reduce font sizes (title, author, volume) on volume divider
  pages. (Requested by OGS)
* Reduce chapter title size to match that of thesis title. (Requested
  by OGS)
* Major modifications and bugfixes to the approval page. Since theses
  are now submitted electronically, signature lines are no longer
  required. Also, the current manual requires affiliation for all
  readers and that the approval date be typed on the page. Reader (and
  advis?r and committeechair) commands are now of the form
  \firstreader{Ignatius Arrogant}[School of Industrial and Systems
  Engineering][Georgia Institute of Technology]. The second and third
  arguments default to \department and Georgia Institute of Technology,
  respectively.
* Remove bold from chapter lines in Table of Contents. Also adjusted
  horizontal spacing in table of contents so that chapter numbers
  lower than XVIII don't overstrike chapter titles.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ version 1.7 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________ version 1.6 ________________
* Make Vita doublespaced
* Correct one-and-a-half-spaced linespace factor to 1.25
  from 1.33 (1.25 is specified by The LaTeX Companion)
* Add support for on-demand patches
* Fix Figure and Table captions to OGS specifications.
* Add leaders (dots) in the table of contents for
  chapters.  (Requested by OGS)

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ version 1.6 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________ version 1.5 ________________

After showing version 1.4 to GT OGS, almost all features were
approved.  Only a few, pre-approved changes were made in this
1.5 release:

* Caption labels:

	The 'Figure X:' or 'Table Y:' part of a caption is now
   printed in bold san-serif.  If you want to customize this,
   use the caption2 package.  OGS is not concerned about the
   details here, as long as you are consistent throughout.

* List of Symbols:

   Now handled by the gatech-thesis-losa style instead of the
   gatech-thesis-gloss style.  The -gloss style now generates
	a real glossary.

   OGS suggests that all symbol defintions be rigidly separated
   from the  symbols themselves.  In the julesverne/bellswhistles
   example, the was implemented via '\setlength{\losahang}{5cm}',
   to change this:

   SYM1  an explanation of what the "SYM1" stands for.  A really
         long winded explanation so that I can get a linewrap or
         two.

   AVeryLongSymbol  notice that the first line of the definition 
         is intruded upon by the long symbol name, but the linewraps
         are aligned at the original point.

   ---- to ----

   SYM1             By changing \losahang, all of the definitions
                    now begin and linewrap to a point that is to 
                    the right of the longest symbol name.

   AVeryLongSymbol  However, this tends to look ugly if you have 
                    many short symbols, but one really really long
                    one.  

   You will need to set \losahang manually to an appropriate length, 
   depending on the contents of your glosssary.

   You should use gatech-thesis-losa.sty and the \losa{} command
   to generate a List of Symbols.  Use gatech-thesis-gloss.sty and
	the \gloss command to generate a Glossary.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ version 1.5 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________ version 1.4 ________________

* Style of headings:

	In the most recent version of the OGS Guidelines, the
	specific format of section, subsection, and subsubsection
	headings is no longer specified.  Because underlining is bad
	  (1) underlining for emphasis is bad typesetting, originally
	      used only when italics where not available [e.g. typewriters,
	      for which the original OGS Guidelines were written]
	  (2) Centering doesn't work on underlined text in section titles,
	      so earlier, we faked it with a 2in indent (hoping that all
	      section titles were short).  Bad idea.
	  (3) underlining doesn't break across lines, so if you have a
	      very long section title, it won't wrap.  It was suggested
	      (Elena Garcia) to use the ulem.sty package, but
	        (a) that would add a non-base external dependency to the class
			  (b) it doesn't fix the problem, unless you ALSO use the
	            titlesec.sty package to control section titles.  Which
	            is yet ANOTHER external dependency.
	Given (1) and (2), plus the lack of a requirement by OGS, I've
	redefined the section, subsection, and subsubsection formats thus:
		section:       (old) (not really) centered, underlined, bold
		section:       (new) Large, bold, italic, at left margin
	   subsection:    (old) bold, at left margin
	   subsection:    (new) bold, at left margin
		subsubsection: (old) bold, indented 5 "spaces" from left margin
		subsubsection: (new) italic, indented 0.25in from left margin

* Fixed bug that caused problems when last section of the document
  (vita?) in \included instead of \inputted

* Chapter headings fixups (only really applies if you're using
  pagestyle{tcplain} or pagestyle{gtthesis} -- for personal copies?)

	Minor headings fixups: in short "chapters" (vita, references) which 
	will NOT have sections, the chapter header markers are not appropriate.
	Normal is: \rightmark has chapter name, \leftmark has section name 
	.(when no sections, like vita, \leftmark is empty).  It is up to 
	the pagestyle whether the \marks are used.  We only use them in 
	gtthesis style.  So, these known-short chapters should override
	the markers and mark both left and right with the "chapter" name:
	plus, they shouldn't read "Chapter *: Vita" but simply "Vita".

	QUESTION: perhaps abstract, TOC, LOT, ... should get similar 
	treatment?  How likely is it that they will run more than two pages
	long?
	
* Massive signature page improvements.  OGS Guidelines say that
  if there are more than four signatories, then the signature
  lines must be arranged in two columns.  Before, it didn't.  Now
  it does.
	
* Fix pagenumbering.  New OGS guidelines say that pagenumbers should
  go on the bottom in the middle, not in the upper right corner.
  This means that 'plain' is now the default pagestyle.  (Old 'gtplain'
  is now renamed to 'tcplain' -- it's plain, except that the pagenumbers
  are in the Top Corner. It no longer has anything to do with Georgia
  Tech, so change the name to something else...hence, tcplain)

* Reorganized the examples. There are now three: the super-simple,
  very basic ``example-thesis.tex'', the moderately more advanced
  julesverne/basic/ example, and the full-blown, all the bells and
  whistles example in julesverne/bellswhistles.

* More pagenumbering fixes: signature page should not be numbered.

* Dedication page: text is automatically centered, per OGS requirements.
  Looks ugly to me; for personal copies override dedicationtop/bottom:
    \renewcommand*{\dedicationtop}{\vspace*{\stretch{1}}
    \renewcommand*{\dedicationbottom}{\vspace*{\stretch{3}}
  looks nice to me (for UNOFFICIAL copies).

* Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables:
  OGS guidelines say that items in these lists should be single spaced
  if a single entry requires more than one line, but that separate
  entries should be doubled spaced.  It wasn't before.  Now it is.

* Multivolume Thesis support:
  Use the \part{} sectioning commands to indicate where Volume II 
  (III, etc) should begin.  Put \multivolumetrue in your preamble, and 
  gatech-thesis.cls will automatically generate the volume I "title"
  page (in addition to the "real" title page.
  
  It's unclear whether the volume title pages should look the same
  as the "real" title page, or if the volume I title page should BE
  the "real" title page.  I've made some guesses.  If I find out 
  differently, I'll change it.
  
* gatech-thesis.cls now depends on the base package 'calc'. This
  should not be a big deal, 'calc' is a part of the standard
  LaTeX2e distribution.

* Lists of Symbols and Abbreviations, and Index:
  incorporate minimal support for glossary page and index page
  within gatech-thesis.cls.  However, most functionality is 
  kept in the add-on, option style files
    gatech-thesis-index.sty and 
    gatech-thesis-gloss.sty
  Read the comments in those files for more information. 

* Bibliography style: gatech-thesis.bst based on ieeetr.bst.  Thanks
  to Elena Garcia for the prod, although this version has
  a separate heritage than her submission.

* Included code: gatech-thesis.cls now includes David Carlisle's
  \@removefromreset command as specified in the remreset package 
  available from CTAN as 
    macros/latex/contrib/supported/carlisle/remreset.sty
  It is provided here as a convenience to the user, and because
  it helps me eliminate a major kludge within gatech-thesis.cls.
  The code is included with David Carlisle's permission.  
  remreset.sty is licensed under the LPPL; David has explicitly 
  given permission to include it here, under the GPL.

* Minor fixups for two-sided printing
  make sure that the last page of the preliminary environment is even,
  so that Chapter 1 starts on an odd page.  (Page numbers were always 
  right, but we need to go ahead an print the blank page, so that
  duplex printers don't get confused.)  It didn't before.  Now it does.
