This is the README file for the GATECH-THESIS class for LaTeX.
It corresponds to version 1.5 of the GATECH-THESIS class 
(17 August 2002)

GATECH-THESIS may be obtained from any of the following locations:

   http://www.grad.gatech.edu/thesis/index.html
     this is where the official version, approved by the Georgia
     Tech Office of Graduate Studies, may be found.  Do NOT
     attempt to use the old, out-of-date, LaTeX2.09 style file
     (gtthesis.sty) that is STILL on cyberbuzz.

   http://www.neuro.gatech.edu/users/cwilson/gatech-thesis/
	  the most recent version, plus archives of all past versions
	  will always be here.

   http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/gatech-thesis/
     and of course, CTAN.

This class file can be used with the LaTeX typesetting system
to produce dissertations that adhere to Georgia Tech's guidelines
for publishing.  

There are a number of files within this archive.  The important
ones are 

   gatech-thesis.cls
   gatech-thesis.bst
   gatech-thesis-gloss.sty
   gatech-thesis-losa.sty
   gatech-thesis-losa.bst
   gatech-thesis-index.sty
   gatech-thesis-index.ist

Everything else is fluff: examples, licensing, documentation...

=============================
Using the GATECH-THESIS class
=============================

First, read this file.  Then read COMPLIANCE.  Then read
INSTALL.  Take a peek a NEWS, and then (maybe) CHANGES.
Then you can worry about the examples...

Sample File
-----------

example-thesis.tex + example-thesis.bib

There is a sample dissertation (by the fictitious, but very
irritating, Perry H Disdainful) in the file example-thesis.tex.  It 
also uses example-thesis.bib as its bibliography database (though 
the contents of the database are not important).  Mostly this is 
useful as an example of how to produce the front matter.  If you 
don't understand LaTeX at all, this file might help you get started, 
but, since you're going to be writing a 100+ page document, you 
should invest in a copy of the LaTeX manual (by Leslie Lamport, the 
original author of LaTeX). This has recently been updated for 
LaTeX2e (1, below).

The LaTeX Companion, by Goossens, Mittelbach, and Samarin (who have been
involved in developing and supporting LaTeX2e) is also quite good.  It 
gives a lot of useful information if you are going to be writing or 
modifying classes, and gives a lot of additional information on commonly
available style packages (2, below).

Helpful books (in no particular order): 
  (1) "LaTeX: A Document Preparation System" by Leslie Lamport
  (2) "The LaTeX Companion" by Goossens, Mittelbach, and Samarin
  (3) "A Guide to LaTeX" by Helmut Kopka and Patrick Daly
  (4) "LaTeX: Line by Line" by Antoni Diller
  (5) "The LaTeX Graphics Companion"
  (6) "The TeXbook" by Donald Knuth

Larger Sample
-------------

julesverne/basic/*

This is a slightly more complicated, multi-file example.  The text
is taken from the first five chapters of the Project Gutenberg edition 
of Jules Verne's ``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and is freely 
redistributable as long as the complete text, 2000010.txt, accompanies 
the other excerpts. The original document is also available here:
  http://promo.net/pg/
  ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext94/2000010.txt
This example can be built with either latex (to generate a .dvi file) or
with pdflatex (to generate a .pdf file). 

Gory, all-the-bells-and-whistles example:
------------

julesverne/bellswhistles/*

This directory contains a reworked version of the jules-verne
example "thesis".  However, all of the bells and whistles 
provided by the gatech-thesis.cls class and associated styles
are exercised, along with some suggestions for thesis document 
structuring.

Features:
  *)  segregating preamble code into a document-specific style
  *)  How to easily generate OGS format complant documents
      and prettier, "personal" copies.
  *)  Support for using hyperref (clickable links in the TOC,
      when making a .pdf)
  *)  Using postscript versions of fonts other than Computer Modern,
      like Times, Courier, etc.  See extensive comments in
      jules-verne.sty.
  *)  Using the listings package for including program code
      in appendices
  *)  Using the add-on style gatech-thesis-gloss.sty for 
      generating a glossary
  *)  Using the add-on style gatech-thesis-losa.sty for
      generating a "List of Symbols or Abbreviations"
  *)  Using the add-on style gatech-thesis-index.sty for 
      generating an index.  Typically a GT thesis doesn't
      have one of these, but the style is provided just in case.
  *)  Demonstrate the multivolume support, for those theses that
      are over 2.5" thick (according to OGS Guidelines).
  *)  Using \include instead of \input to incorporate subsidiary
      files into the main document.  This lets you use \includeonly
      to speed development of your document.

This example requires some additional work to prepare your LaTeX 
system, before you can compile it.  See the local documentation,
julesverne/bellswhistles/00README.

Building the Examples
---------------------

To compile the examples, you must first install the gatech-thesis 
files (see the INSTALL document).  Also, the bells-and-whistles 
example needs some additional preparation; see its local documentation
in julesverne/bellswhistels/00README.

However, once you have all of the required items installed, you can
build the simplest example by executing the following commands:

latex example-thesis.tex
bibtex example-thesis
latex example-thesis.tex
latex example-thesis.tex
dvips example-thesis
  (generates a postscript file)

To build the other examples, run the DO_* scripts.  For instance,
if you are using a unix or unix-like system, cd to the julesverne/basic
directory and execute:

  ./DO_postscript.sh
  
to generate a postscript output (or ./DO_pdf.sh to generate a pdf).
If, on the other hand, you are on a DOS-ish system, the execute 
instead the file

  DO_postscript.bat

(or DO_pdf.bat)  To understand what the scripts do (especially the
ones in the julesverne/bellswhistles/ directory) you really ought
to read thru them...

Choosing the GATECH-THESIS class
--------------------------------

To use the GATECH-THESIS class, make sure that the gatech-thesis.cls 
file is on your TEXINPUTS search path and use the following command 
at the start of your input file:

\documentclass{gatech-thesis}

To insure that gatech-thesis.cls is on your TEXINPUTS search path, 
you can copy it into your localtexmf tree and then update the file
database; or you can place it into the same directory as your
thesis .tex files themselves.  This is also described in the INSTALL
document.

=================================
What the GATECH-THESIS class does
=================================

The GATECH-THESIS class builds on the the standard LaTeX REPORT class,
and is accepted for use with Georgia Institute of Technology PhD 
dissertations and Masters theses.  The available commands are almost 
identical to those of the REPORT class, so your best starting point 
for documentation is the LaTeX manual written by Leslie Lamport.

The key features of the class are:

1) The primary modification to the REPORT class is the use of
pseudo-double-spacing, since Georgia Tech's rules are still designed
for typewriters.  This is achieved by increasing the \baselinestretch
parameter to 1.33.  The \baselinestretch is returned to a
single-spaced value of 1.00 for elements like tables, captions, and
footnotes and for all displayed text (quote, quotation, and verse
environments).  

2) Margins are 1.5" on left, 1" on top, right and bottom (headers & 
footers 1/4" from body)

3) Use 11 point by default; you can use the 10pt or 12pt options

4) Page numbers are in the center at the bottom of the page

5) Complete, correct front matter for Georgia Tech dissertations can
be generated.

Options
---------------

There are a number of primary options.  However, if called without
any options, the approved format -- 11pt, letterpaper, oneside,
doublespaced, normalmargins, final -- will be generated.


Any standard option for the LaTeX2e `report' class, including
`10pt', `11pt', `12pt', `oneside', `twoside', etc. is valid.

`singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or `doublespaced': 
   Set the entire document's default line spacing, except for 
   notes, which are single-spaced by default.

`spacednotes':  Let the line spacing of notes be determined
   by the line spacing of the main document, instead of being
   forced single-spaced.

`normalmargins', `narrowmargins', `widemargins', `extrawidemargins'
   or `oldmargins':  normalmargins is the default and Georgia Tech-
   approved format.  Oldmargins is the OLD Georgia Tech format. 

`draft':  Produce a draft copy (10pt font, double-sided,
   double-spaced, normal margins, with the word ``DRAFT'' printed
   at all four corners of every page, and current date printed in
   a running header).

`final': style uses the correct pseudo-double-spacing.  This option
   is the default and is redundant, but is included for symmetry.

`hyperref': Indicates that the document will \usepackage{hyperref}.
   This is a kludge, but I didn't want to explicitly *require*
   hyperref, so we must indicate to gatech-thesis.cls whether it should
   define certain hyperref commands as dummies.  ALWAYS use this
   option if you use the hyperref package.  NEVER use this option if
   you do not also use the hyperref package.

The options are selected on the \documentclass line, e.g.:

\documentclass[10pt,hyperref,draft]{gatech-thesis}

Thus, the default options:
   \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper,oneside,
                  doublespaced,normalmargins,final]{gatech-thesis}
will generate a document that conforms to the graduate studies office
and is identical to setting no options at all
   \documentclass{gatech-thesis}

Page Headers
------------

If you want to use page headers or footers other than the default
ones, you should try using ``fancyheadings.sty''.  It is easy to use,
widely distributed, and well documented.  However, the default headers
and footers are the Georgia Tech-approved ones.  There are also
some interesting variations defined within the gatech-thesis.cls 
itself (tcplain, gtthesis), but those should ONLY be used for personal 
copies, and NOT for your official version.  See the 
julesverne/bellswhistles example.

============
Front matter
============

The other key service provided by this class is that it generates
correct front matter (title page, approval page, dedication, etc.) with
a fairly simple set of commands.  The format of the front matter is 
specified quite explicitly in the document ``Manual for Graduate Theses:
Georgia Institute of Technology'' distributed by Office of Graduate 
Studies.

A complete example of the use of the front matter commands can be
found in any of the examples distributed with the class 
(example-thesis.tex or julesverne/basic or julesversion/bellswhistles).

Declarations
------------

To use the front matter macros and environments, you must first
declare a number of text strings within the preamble of your document 
(that is, these must be declared BEFORE the \begin{document} command.)

\title{...}         Dissertation title

\author{...}        Your name as registered with Georgia Tech

\department{...}    Specify the name of the graduate department.
      \dept{...}    synonym

\degree{...}        Title of your degree (e.g. ``Doctor of Philosophy'')

\gradyear{...}      Year your degree will be granted
\copyrightyear{...} synonym

Any or all of the \*reader{}, \committeechair, or \principaladvis?r{}
commands may be ommitted -- but your signature page will look a little
silly if you don't include SOME names.

\principaladvisor{...} Name of your thesis advisor
\principaladviser{...} if you prefer advisor spelled with an e)

\committeechair{...}   Name of your committee chairperson

\firstreader{...}   Name of other committee member
\secondreader{...}  Name of other committee member 
\thirdreader{...}   Name of other committee member
\fourthreader{...}  Name of other committee member
\fifthreader{...}   Name of other committee member
\sixthreader{...}   Name of other committee member

\bibfiles{...}      List of files to use when generating a bibliography 

\submitdate{...}    Specify the ``month year'' in which dissertation 
                    submitted

\linespacing{...}   Use this to override the default double-spacing.  
                    NOT recommended; the default is approved by the 
                    Graduate Studies Office.  For draft/personal copies,
                    use the ``draft'' or ``singlespace'' options in your
                    documentclass statement, instead.
\spacing{...}       compatibility synonym

Switches
------------

Also, there are a number of ``true/false'' flags that can be used to 
control the frontmatter generation.  However, the defaults will result 
in the approved Georgia Tech format.  These flags, if specified, should 
also be in the document preamble (BEFORE the \begin{document} command).

\titlepagetrue or \titlepagefalse
     - produce or don't produce a title page (TRUE by default)

\signaturepagetrue or \signaturepagefalse
     - produce or don't produce a signature page (TRUE by default)

\copyrighttrue or \copyrightfalse
     - place or don't place a copyright notice on the title page 
       (FALSE by default)

\figurespagetrue or \figurespagefalse
     - produce or don't produce a List of Figures page (TRUE by default)

\tablespagetrue or \tablespagefalse
     - produce or don't produce a List of Tables page (TRUE by default)

\contentspagetrue or \contentspagefalse
     - produce or don't produce a Table of Contents page 
       (TRUE by default)

\bibpagetrue or \bibpagefalse
     - produce or don't produce a Bibliography page (TRUE by default)

\thesisproposaltrue or \thesisproposalfalse
     - indicate ``Thesis Proposal'' or ``Thesis'' on the title page 
       (FALSE by default -- e.g. default is to say ``Thesis'')

\dedicationheadingtrue or \dedicationheadingfalse
     - display ``DEDICATION'' heading on the dedication page 
       (FALSE by default)

\strictmarginstrue or \strictmarginsfalse
     - if true, then obey the margin rules EVEN on the title and 
       signature page. Default TRUE and REQUIRED by Graduate Studies 
       Office, but not very appealing.  (under ``oldmargins'' an extra 
       50p spacing is added so that the title page looks like the 
       chapter headings.  In any case, \strictmarginsfalse looks better 
       for personal copies but \strictmarginstrue is necessary for 
       official ones.

\multivolumetrue or \multivolumefalse
     - if true, indicates that the thesis will span multiple volumes. 
       triggers automatic generation of the first volume title page
       (in addition to the ``entire work'' title page), but it''s up
       to you to place the ``part{}'' commands in the appropriate
       locations for volume 2, volume 3, etc.

Frontmatter Environments
------------------------
GATECH-THESIS provides a number of specialized environments for the
various frontmatter sections.  Of course, you don't have to use them
all.  The provided environments include
  
  dedication:        \begin{dedication}
                     text here
                     \end{dedication}

  preface:           \begin{preface}
                     text here
                     \end{preface}

  acknowledgements:  \begin{acknowledgements}
                     text here
                     \end{acknowledgements}

  abstract:          \begin{abstract}
                     text here
                     \end{abstract}
 
  summary:           \begin{summary}
                     text here
                     \end{summary}

And if that isn't enough for you, you can add your own:
   \prefacesection{other-title}{...text...}
Note that these add-a-sections aren't true environments (they do not 
have \begin{} and \end{} statements.  So, for a ``forward'' section:

   \prefacesection{forward}{text here}

The ``Preliminary'' environment
-----------------------------

ALL of these preceeding environments MUST be enclosed within the
``preliminary'' environment, which ensures that page-numbering is 
handled properly (e.g. no page number on the title page or signature
page, use lower case roman numerals to number the frontmatter pages, 
reset the page numbers to start with arabic 1).  Within this preliminary 
environment, you put the environments and commands for the rest of 
the front matter.

Each environment makes its contents start on a new page.  They also 
emblazon the first page with a heading -- all except for the dedication
environment.  For formatting the dedication page, you're on your own.
After all, the dedication is a kind of poetry and there's no predicting 
the right way to format poetry.  Actually, that's not entirely true:
according to the OGS Guidelines, the dedication material should be
centered vertically, so your text will be automatically centered.  If 
you wish to override this centerring behavior, just redefine the 
dedicationtop and dedicationbottom commands:
         \renewcommand{\dedicationtop}{\vspace*{\stretch{1}}
         \renewcommand{\dedicationbottom{\vspace*{\stretch{3}}
Will position your dedication at about 1/4 of the way down the page.
Also, if you *want* an ugly ``DEDICATION'' heading emblazoned in
bold centered letters at the top of the page, you can use the 
\dedicationheadingtrue switch within the preamble.

  \begin{preliminary}
    The other environments go in here, along with
    \contents
  \end{preliminary}

Table of Contents, Figures, and Tables
--------------------------------------

\contents

At the appropriate point within the frontmatter, generate these tables 
by issuing the \contents command.  You can modify the look of the Table 
of Contents with the following commands -- which should be executed 
within the \begin{preliminary}...\end{preliminary} environment (see 
below) but before the \contents command.

If you also want a ``List of Symbols or Abbreviations'', you can
use the gatech-thesis-losa.sty add-on package: in your preamble, just
  \usepackage{gatech-thesis-losa}
  \losafiles{your-symbols-database}
And then sprinkle references to your symbols or abbreviations 
within your text.  Read the header in gatech-thesis-losa.sty itself 
for more information, and see how the julesverne/bellswhistles/ 
example does it (and don't forget to read the documenation on the 
`gloss' package, which is used by gatech-thesis-losa.sty).  You 
also will need to run `bibtex' on the LOSA database; see the above 
documentation.

If you want a Glossary or ``List of Nomenclature'', you can
use the gatech-thesis-gloss.sty add-on package: in your preamble, just
  \usepackage{gatech-thesis-gloss}
  \glossfiles{glossary-database}
And then sprinkle references to your glossary terms 
within your text.  Read the header in gatech-thesis-gloss.sty itself 
for more information, and see how the julesverne/bellswhistles/ 
example does it (and don't forget to read the documenation on the 
`gloss' package, which is used by gatech-thesis-gloss.sty).  You 
also will need to run `bibtex' on the glossary database; see the above 
documentation.

\labelchaptersintableofcontents 
   inserts an entry into the TOC that says ``CHAPTERS'' just 
   before Chapter 1. Not recommended.

\labelappendicesintableofcontents
   inserts an entry into the TOC that says ``APPENDICES'' just 
   before Appendix A. Not recommended.

\setchaptertocdepth
   set the default for how ``deep'' to number within chapters
   in the table of contents.  Defaults to subsections.

\setappendixtocdepth
   set the default for how ``deep'' to number within appendices
   (chapter{}'s after the \appendix command} in the table of
   contents.  Defaults to Appendices only (no sections or subs)

\settocdepth
   temporarily change how ``deep'' to number in the table of 
   contents for current chapter/section.  For example, you
   usually include \section{}'s in the TOC (\setchaptertocdepth{1})
   but in chapter 5 you want to include subsection as well:
   \chapter{This is Chapter 5}\settocdepth{2}.  In chapter 6 the
   default depth of 1 is reasserted.
  
You should never need to call \setcounter{tocdepth}{..} directly.

Use the following numbers with the various tocdepth commands above:
   0 = chapter only
   1 = chapter + sections
   2 = chapter, section, subsection
   3 = chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection


==========
End matter
==========

Similarly, the end matter components (bibliography, vita, index, 
afterward, etc) MUST be enclosed in a ``postliminary'' environment.

GATECH-THESIS provides a few (okay, one) specialized environments for 
the various endmatter sections, as well.
  
  vita:    \begin{vita}
           text here
           \end{vita}

And you want other sections (afterword, index), you can add them:
   \postfacesection{other-title}{...text...}
Note that these add-a-sections aren't true environments (they do not 
have \begin{} and \end{} statements.  So, for a ``afterword'' section:

   \postfacesection{afterword}{text here}

Additionally, if you want an index, you can use the add-on style
gatech-thesis-index.sty.  Read the comments in that file, and 
see how the julesverne/bellswhistles/ example does it.  Basically,
you just include the following command in your preamble
  \usepackage{gatech-thesis-index}
and sprinkle \index commands within your text.  Don't forget to
read the documentation on the `index' package, on which the
gatech-thesis-index.sty is based.  And you'll need to run makeindex
on the index database -- but that's all explained in the 
documentation and demonstrated by the example.

Bibliography
------------

Also, within the postliminary environment, you should issue the 
  \references
command in order to generate a bibliography in the Georgia Tech-approved
format.  There are a few tricks to getting the \references command to 
work properly, though:

  \bibpagetrue
  \bibfiles{file1,file2,...}

must be set in the preamble.  (Actually, since bibpagetrue is the
default, you don't ACTUALLY need to specify it -- but don't say 
\bibpagefalse and expect \references to work.)  Also, 

  \bibliographystyle{...} 

should be specified just after \begin{document}.  Yes, it's a bit 
confusing, but see the example files (example-thesis.tex,
julesverne/basic/jules-verne.tex, or 
julesverne/bellswhistles/jules-verne.sty) and all will be clear.

The updated GSO Guidelines is no longer very specific about the format
of bibliographic entries (although the example bibliography IS sorted).
I know of one thesis that was accepted using the``plain'' bibstyle 
(which generates a sorted [not order-of-reference] bibliography). Then,
of course, there's the gatech-thesis.bst bibliography format, which
has been approved by the GSO.  So, you'll want to use

  \bibliographystyle{gatech-thesis}
or
  \bibliographystyle{plain}

=========
Main Body
=========

See any book on LaTeX's report class for more information, but the 
following deserves special mention:

``\appendix'' is a global mode switch that changes the way ``chapter'' 
headings and TOC entries are generated.
  \chapter{last chapter title}
  \appendix
  \chapter{first appendix title}
Note that you use the ``\chapter'' command to indicate new appendices --
but only after switching the ``mode'' with the \appendix command.

=====================================================
Other commands not found in the standard report style
=====================================================

The GATECH-THESIS class also provides several other helpful environments
and commands.  These include

ignore{...}  or   comment{...}
     Ignore the part of the file between { and } (can include
     paragraph breaks); useful for commenting out large blocks.

\begin{longquote}...\end{longquote}:
     Single-spaced version of the `quote' environment

\begin{longquotation}...\end{longquotation}:
     Single-spaced version of the `quotation' environment.

\begin{singlespaced}...\end{singlespaced}:
     Format single-spaced paragraphs.

\begin{oneandahalfspaced}...\end{oneandahalfspaced}:
     Format 1 1/2-spaced paragraphs.

\begin{doublespaced}...\end{doublespaced}:
     Format double-spaced paragraphs.

\begin{newspacing}{<n>}...\end{newspacing}:
     Format paragraphs with an interline spacing of `n'.

\clearemptydoublepage, \clearplaindoublepage, \cleargtplaindoublepage:
     Same as \cleardoublepage except that it sets the pagestyle of
     any inserted blank page to `empty' `plain' or `gtplain', 
     respectively.

Modifying the look of the document
----------------------------------

There are also a number of commands that can be used to change the
look.  However, the default ``look'' is the one approved by 
Georgia Tech's Graduate Studies Office, so don't use these 
``look-altering'' commands for your official versions -- only for 
personal copies.

\setbodypagestyle{x}, where x = plain (the default and OGS approved), 
   empty, headings, myheadings, gtthesis, or tcplain.  Avoid myheadings; 
   use the fancyheaders package instead.

\setfrontpagestyle{x} - set pagestyle for frontmatter
\setbackpagestyle{x}   - set pagestyle for endmatter
    
The Graduate Studies Office approved pagestyle is plain for 
the body, as well frontmatter and endmatter.  (However, pages are 
numbered with roman numberals in the frontmatter and automatically 
switch to arabic numbers in the body and endmatter, as required by GSO. 
Don't try to change the pagenumbering style).  However:

   - `gtthesis' pagestyle adds a running header on each page 
     identifying the Chapter (and Section for twopage layouts).
     This is a nice touch IMO for the body and endmatter, but 
     use it ONLY for personal copies.

   - note that you also need to add \pagestyle{gtthesis}
     if you use \setbodypagestyle{gtthesis}.  See the 
     julesverne/bellswhistles/jules-verne.sty for an example of 
     how to handle this for unofficial copies.

Chapter headings and the TOC use ROMAN numerals, but the running headers
at the top of each page use ARABIC numbers for the Chapter number.  
Thus, there are two separate formats that are used.

   \thegtchapter is used for ROMAN chapter numbers
   \thechapter is used for ARABIC chapter numbers

If you wish all chapter headings to use ROMAN, then just redefine 
\thechapter in your document:
   \renewcommand{\thechapter}{\thegtchapter}
Do the reverse if you want all ARABIC chapter numbers:
   \renewcommand{\thegtchapter}{\thechapter}

Final Notes
===========

For more information about the GATECH-THESIS class and its options, 
look inside the class file itself -- it is heavily commented.  Also, 
the add-on styles contain helpful comments -- and you should read 
all of the various READMEs and the comments within the ``root''
example files:
  example-thesis.tex

Also, it wouldn't hurt to read the NEWS file, the NOTES file, and the
CHANGES file -- but I'd stay away from the ChangeLog unless you're a 
real glutton for punishment.

And read the COMPLIANCE file -- it is a blow-by-blow commentary
on the Office of Graduate Studies Style Manual for Theses, and 
how it relates/is implemented by GATECH-THESIS.

Backward Compatibility
----------------------

There are a number of commands available within gatech-thesis.cls that
are purely for backward compatibility with the older official 
gt-thesis.sty style file that was previously provided by the Georgia 
Tech Graduate Studies Office.  In theory, one could take a disseration
that previously began:

  documentstyle{report}
  \usepackage{gt-thesis.sty}

and replace those two commands with

  documentclass{gatech-thesis}

And it should ``just work''(tm).  These backwards compatibility commands
are not recommended for NEW documents, and they are described only in
the comments inside the gatech-thesis.cls file itself.
